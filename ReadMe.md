# Allocate Mate ðŸ’²

_Automatic Financial Paycheck Budgeter and Advisor._

## Inspiration

Managing a paycheck is harder than it looks. Most apps are either too simple (just calculators) or too overwhelming (lots of graphs, locked features). We wanted to create a tool that is dynamic, intuitive, and AI-powered so anyone can track their spending, set goals, and adjust budgets easily.

## What We Learned

- How to build a full-stack web app by connecting a Python Flask backend with a JavaScript, HTML and CSS frontend
- How to structure data between client and server using REST APIs and JSON
- How to integrate Google Gemini AI to provide personalized insights and recommendations
- The importance of balancing UI/UX with functionality
- How We Built It

## We developed the project in three layers:

### Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

- Clean, responsive UI built from scratch
- Users can add, edit, and delete budget categories in real time
- Smooth interactions with animations for a better user experience

### Backend (Flask and Python)

- Handles paycheck and category inputs
- Supports both fixed amounts and percent-based allocations
- Saves results in a history log for tracking past paychecks

### AI Integration (Gemini)

- Provides smart insights based on spending patterns
- Helps users set financial goals and receive tailored recommendations

### Communication flow: Frontend (JS/HTML/CSS) <-> Backend (Flask) <-> Gemini AI

## Challenges We Faced

- Debugging Flask reload and port conflicts
- Keeping the frontend clean while adding dynamic features
- Syncing the teamâ€™s work across frontend, backend, and AI integration under hackathon time pressure
